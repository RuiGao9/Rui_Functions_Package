def SolarRadiationCalculator(Latitude,DOY,Year,Print):
    '''
    This function is built based on the learning materials formed by G.P. Merkley.
    The original equations are taken from Allen, et al. (1993),
    Duffie and Beckman (1980), and London and Frohlich (1982)
    
    Parameters:
    Latitude: the latitude of the place.
    DOY: day of year.
    Year: the year with four digital number, eg., 2024.
    Print: if you want to see the results during the calculation. 
            "YES", showing the results, and other comments (string format) won't show the results.

    Return:
    Solar radiation will be returned.
